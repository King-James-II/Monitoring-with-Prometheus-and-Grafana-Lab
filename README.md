# Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana Lab

- Configured Prometheus Targets: Defined systems/applications for Prometheus to scrape metrics from.
- Set Up Grafana Data Source: Established a connection between Grafana and Prometheus, allowing Grafana to access Prometheus data.
- Created Metric Queries: Developed PromQL queries to extract specific metrics from the scraped data.
- Determined Target Status: Analyzed target health through Prometheus to identify unavailable/unhealthy targets.
- Visualized Target Information: Gathered details about the monitored targets and visualized the collected metrics with graphs in Grafana.
